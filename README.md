Minecraft-MP-Notification-Panel
===============================

A notification panel originally created for a norwegian minecraft server to store notes, kicks and bans on their players. Includes API for easy storage of this data.

Important:
Large portions of the script is terribly coded and should be redone. Security should be increased as well. I donâ€™t even remember if the passwords are properly salted. Script should not be used as is.
